🚀 Stay Ahead in the World of Crypto and NFTs! 🌟
In this project, I’ve developed a web application that allows you to analyze both cryptocurrencies and the most popular NFT collections in detail! 🎉 Using demo API integrations, this application serves as a basic solution to help you explore the fundamentals of these technologies.
🔍 About the Project
Staying updated in the dynamic world of crypto and NFTs has never been easier! This application integrates CoinGecko API and OpenSea API to deliver real-time market data and trending NFT collections directly to your screen. Please note: Since the APIs are in demo mode, data retrieval is limited.
🛠️ Key Features:
Live Cryptocurrency Data: Track real-time prices, market caps, and hourly, daily, and weekly percentage changes of popular coins.
NFT Collections: Browse trending NFT collections powered by OpenSea API, showcasing images, floor prices, and trading volumes.
Performance Analytics: Explore the 7-day price movement of each coin with interactive, detailed charts.
User-Friendly Interface: Access cryptocurrency and NFT data with just a click through a clean and responsive design.
Paginated Data: Organized tables for seamless browsing of crypto and NFT information.
💻 Technical Highlights:
React & Redux: Ensuring a dynamic and smooth user experience.
Next.js: Optimized performance with SEO-friendly architecture.
Chart.js: Visualizing coin price trends with modern charts.
TypeScript: A reliable, scalable, and type-safe codebase.
OpenSea API Integration: Fetching real-time data for trending NFT collections.
Tailwind CSS: Elegant and fast styling for a modern interface.
🌟 The Goal of the Application:
This project is designed to meet the needs of both crypto investors and NFT enthusiasts. Analyze market trends, track your investments, and stay updated with the latest buzz in the NFT world!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
